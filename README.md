GettingAndCleaningData-Project
==============================
1. According to use this script you need to download data from     https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
2. Once you download the data you need to put the .R script in the directory.
3. I asume UCI HAR Dataset is a folder in the directory and .R script is outside this folder. 
4. So, dir current_directory should give:
 - UCI HAR Dataset
 - .R script
5. Running the code creates 2 .txt files according to what we needed to do.
6. Thanks for investing time in this.
